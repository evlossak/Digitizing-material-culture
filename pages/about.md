## How do we digitize toys, objects that are meant to be in motion, to be interacted with, rather than remain static? This exhibition asks us to reflect on what is gained and what is lost through the process of digitization.

This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

{% include feature/abouttheabout.md %}
